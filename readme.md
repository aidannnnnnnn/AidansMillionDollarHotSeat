# Aidan's Million Dollar Hot Seat

Hello, and welcome to what essentially was my major project work in 2021 (I have recently modified it since). Here, I have made my own version of the Million Dollar Hot Seat Game, at the time, using my skills in Python (mainly relating to database management, and new skills in Python app development using Kivy and Tkinter). 

This project was made in Python 3.9, and run using Visual Studio Code. For the below setup and execution of the programs to work, please ensure you are in the AI.EVC_2021 folder:

`cd AI.EVC_2021`

# Installing required libraries
For the code to work, you will need to install a set of libraries in your terminal, such as Tkinter and Kivy. All the required libraries are listed in requirements.txt, hence you can quickly install them by running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

# Running the program
To make the program running as seamless as possible, please ensure that you are in the AI.EVC_2021 folder. Once you are there, you can run the following command, which will load the game:

`python3 runapp.py`
